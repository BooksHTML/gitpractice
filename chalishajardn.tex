The geometric theta correspondence of Kudla-Millson \cite{KM90} for the cocycle $\varphi^V_{2}$ in this situation takes the following shape. For a {\it compact} cycle $C$ in $X$, we have that 
\begin{equation}\label{KM-id}
\langle \theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}, C \rangle =  \int_C  \theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}= \sum_{n \geq 0} (C_n \cdot C) q^n
\end{equation}
is a holomorphic modular form of weight $2$ and is equal to the generating series of the  intersection numbers with $C_n$. Here $q = e^{2\pi i \tau}$ with $\tau \in \h$. 
(There is a similar statement for the pairing of $\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}$ with a closed {\it compactly supported} differential $2$-form on ${X}$ representing a class in $H^2_c(X)$, see Theorem~\ref{KM90}). Our first result is 

\begin{theorem}\label{FM-boundaryexact}  (Theorem~\ref{globalexact})
The \bf{differential form} $\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}$ on $X$ extends to a form on $\overline{X}$, and the restriction $k^{\ast}$ of $\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}$ to $\partial \overline{X}$ gives an {\it exact} differential form on $\partial\overline{X}$. Moreover, there exists a theta series $\theta_{\phi_1^W}$ for a space $W$ of signature $(1,1)$  of weight $2$ with values in the $1$-forms on $\partial \overline{X}$ such that $\theta_{\phi_1^W}$ is a primitive for $k^{\ast} \theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}$:
\[
d (\theta_{\phi_1^W}) = k^{\ast} \theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}.
\]
\end{theorem}

Considering the mapping cone for the inclusion $k: \partial \overline{X} \hookrightarrow \overline{X}$ (see Section~\ref{mappingconesection}) we then view the pair $[\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}, \theta_{\phi_1^W}]$ as an element of the compactly supported cohomology $H^2_c(X)$. Explictly, let $C$ be a relative cycle in $\overline{X}$ representing a class in $H_2({X},\partial {X},\Z)$. Then the Kronecker pairing between $[\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}, \theta_{\phi_1^W}]$ and $C$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{mappingconelift}
\langle [\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}, \theta_{\phi_1^W}], C \rangle = \int_C  \theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}
 - \int_{\partial C} \theta_{\phi_1^W}.
\end{equation}
In this way, we obtain an extension of the geometric theta lift which captures the non-compact situation.

To describe the geometric interpretation of this extension, we study the cycle $C_n$ at the boundary $\partial \overline{X}$ (Section~\ref{capped-cycles}). The intersection of $C_n$ with $\partial \overline{X}$ is a union of circles contained in the torus fibers of Sol. But rationally such circles are homologically trivial. Hence we can find a (suitably normalized) rational $2$-chain $A_n$ in $\partial \overline{X}$ whose boundary is the boundary of $C_n$ in $\partial \overline{X}$. ``Capping'' off $C_n$ by $A_n$, we obtain a {\it closed} cycle $C_n^c$ in $\overline{X}$ defining a class in $H_2({X},\Q)$. Our main result is the extension of \eqref{KM-id}:
\begin{theorem}\label{FMHZ-main} (Theorem~\ref{FM-main-th})
 Let $C$ be a relative cycle in $\overline{X}$. Then
\[
\langle [\theta_{\varphi^V_{2}}, \theta_{\phi_1^W}], C \rangle  = \sum_{n \geq 0} (C_n^c \cdot C)q^n
\]
is a holomorphic modular form of weight $2$ and is equal to the generating series of the  intersection numbers with the capped cycles $C^c_n$. (Similarly for the pairing with an arbitrary closed $2$-form on $\overline{X}$ representing a class in $H^2(X)$).
\end{theorem}
